        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="/about me/aboutme.PNG" alt="">
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Wania and I work as a Website Developer, Website Designer, Website Manager or Web Master, and a WordPress
            Developer. I'm a mostly self taught student skilled in HTML, CSS and JavaScript; basically Frontend Development.
            I have experiance designing responsive websites on Figma and then coding them into a fully functioning static 
            website.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a computer science student currently learning Python (for backend), and Blender (Animation) too.</p>
        <p>
            If you've looked at my dashboard, you'd know that my taste is rather minimalistic or more elegant. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I take up mainly small scale projects by small scale businesses, non profits, Individuals, etc. I'm a big fan of
            girls or women based projects by or for girls or women. I give special disocunts for such ones with the first month
            being absolutely free. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming to the second part of my identity; Climate Change Activist, I give out special disocunts for awareness
            projects or small scale non profits of all kind because I believe change happens at a local level. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why Choose Me?<br>
            I'll try to sum it up in <b>five</b> main points:
            <ol>
                <li>I'm quick, reliable, I know my limitations as much as I know my strengths. As a result 
                    your product will be exactly what you and I have agreed upon, nothing less if not more.
                </li>
                <li>I'm extremely hardworking being a student and a woman myself and I never compromise on Client
                    Satisfaction. 
                </li>
                <li>I've been in the Web Development Industry for more than two years now, and I know you might be saying 
                    there are people more experianced than me, you're probably right. But I have a fresh perspective, I have a knack for design and
                    development, and I'm an eternal learner. I'd probably learn to my grave. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I offer free consultation for an unlimited amount of time. So even if you do not require my 
                    my services as a Website Manager, you can still contact me even six months or a year later for any advice or 
                    queries and I'll be delighted to respond and help you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm a very creative and imaginative person something that attracted me towards this very field and urged 
                    me to try and spend a lifetime to build a career into it. I put my all into an idea, a design and then the finished product in the end.
                </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    <p>So here it is. If you're interested or have any questions, contact me at dev.wania@gmail.com and I'll respond within the hour. I look forward towards 
                working with you.</p>
